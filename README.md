## Arguments

- **-r**: The repository containing the workflow
- **-u**: The owner of the repository
- **-a**: The name of your artifact (can be configured in the actions .yml)
- **-w**: The id of the workflow or the name of the actions .yml file
- **-o**: The output path. The file name will always follow this schema: `${artifactName}-${runNumber}.zip`
- **-p**: A personal access token with the `repo` permission

## Example

The following command
```bash
gh-get.exe -r=gh-get -u=m-radmacher -a=example -w="example.yml" -o="./" -p=ghp_
```
would fetch the latest artifact that was generated by the workflow described in [example.yml](/.github/workflows/example.yml).
At the time of writing the fetched file is called `example-2.zip`, since the workflow has only been run twice.
